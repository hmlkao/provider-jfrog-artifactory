                      By default, Artifactory keeps your repositories healthy by refusing POMs with incorrect coordinates (path).
                      If the groupId:artifactId:version information inside the POM does not match the deployed path, Artifactory rejects the deployment with a "409 Conflict" error.
                      You can disable this behavior by setting the Suppress POM Consistency Checks checkbox.
