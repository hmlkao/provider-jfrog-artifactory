            duration_in_minutes: (Number) The maximum duration (in minutes) for policy execution, after which the policy will stop running even if not completed. While setting a maximum run duration for a policy is useful for adhering to a strict archive V2 schedule, it can cause the policy to stop before completion.
            enabled: (Boolean) Enables or disabled the package cleanup policy. This allows the user to run the policy manually. If a policy has a valid cron expression, then it will be scheduled for execution based on it. If a policy is disabled, its future executions will be unscheduled. Defaults to true
            excluded_packages: (Set of String) Specify explicit package names that you want excluded from the policy. Only Name explicit names (and not patterns) are accepted.
            excluded_properties: (Map of List of String) A key-value pair applied to the lead artifact of a package. Packages with this property will be excluded from archival.
            excluded_repos: (Set of String) Specify patterns for repository names or explicit repository names that you want excluded from the archive policy.
            include_all_projects: (Boolean) Set this value to true if you want the policy to run on all Artifactory projects. The default value is false.
            included_packages: '(Set of String) Specify a pattern for a package name or an explicit package name. It accept only single element which can be specific package or pattern, and for including all packages use **. Example: included_packages = ["**"]'
            included_projects: (Set of String) List of projects on which you want this policy to run. To include repositories that are not assigned to any project, enter the project key default.
            included_properties: (Map of List of String) A key-value pair applied to the lead artifact of a package. Packages with this property will be archived.
            keep_last_n_versions: (Number) Set a value for the number of latest versions to keep. The archive policy will remove all versions before the number you select here. The latest version is always excluded.
            key: (String) An ID that is used to identify the archive policy. A minimum of three characters is required and can include letters, numbers, underscore and hyphen.
            last_downloaded_before_in_days: (Number) The archive policy will archive packages based on how long ago they were downloaded. For example, if this parameter is 5 then packages downloaded more than 5 days ago will be archived as part of the policy.
            last_downloaded_before_in_months: (Number, Deprecated) The archive policy will archive packages based on how long ago they were downloaded. For example, if this parameter is 5 then packages downloaded more than 5 months ago will be archived as part of the policy.

            repos: '(Set of String) Specify one or more patterns for the repository name(s) on which you want the archive policy to run. You can also specify explicit repository names. Specifying at least one pattern or explicit name is required. Only packages in repositories that match the pattern or explicit name will be archived. For including all repos use **. Example: repos = ["**"]'
            search_criteria: (Attributes) (see below for nested schema)
            skip_trashcan: (Boolean) A true value means that when this policy is executed, packages will be permanently deleted. false means that when the policy is executed packages will be deleted to the Trash Can. Defaults to false.

                (String) The JFrog Platform Deployment (JPD) supports three ways of mapping groups to LDAP schemas:
                Static: Group objects are aware of their members, however, the users are not aware of the groups they belong to. Each group object such as groupOfNames or groupOfUniqueNames holds its respective member attributes, typically member or uniqueMember, which is a user DN.
                Dynamic: User objects are aware of what groups they belong to, but the group objects are not aware of their members. Each user object contains a custom attribute, such as group, that holds the group DNs or group names of which the user is a member.
                Hierarchy: The user's DN is indicative of the groups the user belongs to by using group names as part of user DN hierarchy. Each user DN contains a list of ou's or custom attributes that make up the group association. For example, uid=user1,ou=developers,ou=uk,dc=jfrog,dc=org indicates that user1 belongs to two groups: uk and developers.

            download_direct: (Boolean) When set, download requests to this repository will redirect the client to download the artifact directly from the cloud storage provider. Available in Enterprise+ and Edge licenses only.
            excludes_pattern: (String) List of artifact patterns to exclude when evaluating artifact requests, in the form of x/y/**/z/*.By default no artifacts are excluded.
            handle_releases: (Boolean) If set, Artifactory allows you to deploy release artifacts into this repository.
            handle_snapshots: (Boolean) If set, Artifactory allows you to deploy snapshot artifacts into this repository.
            includes_pattern: (String) List of comma-separated artifact patterns to include when evaluating artifact requests in the form of x/y/**/z/*. When used, only artifacts matching one of the include patterns are served. By default, all artifacts are included (**/*).
            key: (String) A mandatory identifier for the repository that must be unique. Must be 1 - 64 alphanumeric and hyphen characters. It cannot contain spaces or special characters.
            max_unique_snapshots: (Number) The maximum number of unique snapshots of a single artifact to store. Once the number of snapshots exceeds this setting, older versions are removed. A value of 0 (default) indicates there is no limit, and unique snapshots are not cleaned up.
            notes: (String) Internal description.
            priority_resolution: (Boolean) Setting repositories with priority will cause metadata to be merged only from repositories set with this field
            project_environments: (Set of String) Before Artifactory 7.53.1, up to 2 values (DEV and PROD) are allowed. From 7.53.1 to 7.107.1, only one value is allowed. From 7.107.1, multiple values are allowed.The attribute should only be used if the repository is already assigned to the existing project. If not, the attribute will be ignored by Artifactory, but will remain in the Terraform state, which will create state drift during the update.
            project_key: (String) Project key for assigning this repository to. Must be 2 - 32 lowercase alphanumeric and hyphen characters. When assigning repository to a project, repository key must be prefixed with project key, separated by a dash.
            property_sets: (Set of String) List of property set name
            repo_layout_ref: (String) Sets the layout that the repository should use for storing and identifying modules. A recommended layout that corresponds to the package type defined is suggested, and index packages uploaded and calculate metadata accordingly.
            snapshot_version_behavior: '(String) Specifies the naming convention for Maven SNAPSHOT versions. The options are - unique: Version number is based on a time-stamp (default), non-unique: Version number uses a self-overriding naming pattern of artifactId-version-SNAPSHOT.type, deployer: Respects the settings in the Maven client that is deploying the artifact.'
            suppress_pom_consistency_checks: (Boolean) By default, Artifactory keeps your repositories healthy by refusing POMs with incorrect coordinates (path). If the groupId:artifactId:version information inside the POM does not match the deployed path, Artifactory rejects the deployment with a 409 Conflict error. You can disable this behavior by setting the Suppress POM Consistency Checks checkbox.
            xray_index: (Boolean) Enable Indexing In Xray. Repository will be indexed with the default retention period. You will be able to change it via Xray settings.

            metadata_retrieval_timeout_secs: (Number) Metadata Retrieval Cache Timeout (Sec) in the UI.This value refers to the number of seconds to wait for retrieval from the remote before serving locally cached artifact or fail the request.
            mismatching_mime_types_override_list: '(String) The set of mime types that should override the block_mismatching_mime_types setting. Eg: ''application/json,application/xml''. Default value is empty.'
            missed_cache_period_seconds: (Number) Missed Retrieval Cache Period (Sec) in the UI. The number of seconds to cache artifact retrieval misses (artifact not found). A value of 0 indicates no caching.
            notes: (String) Internal description.
            offline: (Boolean) If set, Artifactory does not try to fetch remote artifacts. Only locally-cached artifacts are retrieved.
            password: (String, Sensitive)
            priority_resolution: (Boolean) Setting repositories with priority will cause metadata to be merged only from repositories set with this field
            project_environments: (Set of String) Before Artifactory 7.53.1, up to 2 values (DEV and PROD) are allowed. From 7.53.1 to 7.107.1, only one value is allowed. From 7.107.1, multiple values are allowed.The attribute should only be used if the repository is already assigned to the existing project. If not, the attribute will be ignored by Artifactory, but will remain in the Terraform state, which will create state drift during the update.
            project_key: (String) Project key for assigning this repository to. Must be 2 - 32 lowercase alphanumeric and hyphen characters. When assigning repository to a project, repository key must be prefixed with project key, separated by a dash.
            properties_enabled: (Boolean) If set, properties for artifacts that have been cached in this repository will be updated if they are modified in the artifact hosted at the remote Artifactory instance. The trigger to synchronize the properties is download of the artifact from the remote repository cache of the local Artifactory instance. Default value is 'false'.
            property_sets: (Set of String) List of property set name
            proxy: (String) Proxy key from Artifactory Proxies settings. Can't be set if disable_proxy = true.
            query_params: '(String) Custom HTTP query parameters that will be automatically included in all remote resource requests. For example: param1=val1&param2=val2&param3=val3'
            remote_repo_layout_ref: (String) Repository layout key for the remote layout mapping. Repository can be created without this attribute (or set to an empty string). Once it's set, it can't be removed by passing an empty string or removing the attribute, that will be ignored by the Artifactory API. UI shows an error message, if the user tries to remove the value.
            repo_layout_ref: (String) Sets the layout that the repository should use for storing and identifying modules. A recommended layout that corresponds to the package type defined is suggested, and index packages uploaded and calculate metadata accordingly.
            retrieval_cache_period_seconds: (Number) Metadata Retrieval Cache Period (Sec) in the UI. This value refers to the number of seconds to cache metadata files before checking for newer versions on remote server. A value of 0 indicates no caching.
            share_configuration: (Boolean, Deprecated)
            socket_timeout_millis: (Number) Network timeout (in ms) to use when establishing a connection and for unanswered requests. Timing out on a network operation is considered a retrieval failure.
            source_origin_absence_detection: (Boolean) If set, Artifactory displays an indication on cached items if they have been deleted from the corresponding repository in the remote Artifactory instance. Default value is 'false'
            statistics_enabled: (Boolean) If set, Artifactory will notify the remote instance whenever an artifact in the Smart Remote Repository is downloaded locally so that it can update its download counter. Note that if this option is not set, there may be a discrepancy between the number of artifacts reported to have been downloaded in the different Artifactory instances of the proxy chain. Default value is 'false'.
            store_artifacts_locally: (Boolean) When set, the repository should store cached artifacts locally. When not set, artifacts are not stored locally, and direct repository-to-client streaming is used. This can be useful for multi-server setups over a high-speed LAN, with one Artifactory caching certain data on central storage, and streaming it directly to satellite pass-though Artifactory servers.
            synchronize_properties: (Boolean) When set, remote artifacts are fetched along with their properties.
            unused_artifacts_cleanup_period_hours: (Number) Unused Artifacts Cleanup Period (Hr) in the UI. The number of hours to wait before an artifact is deemed 'unused' and eligible for cleanup from the repository. A value of 0 means automatic cleanup of cached artifacts is disabled.
            url: (String) This is a URL to the remote registry. Consider using HTTPS to ensure a secure connection.
            username: (String)
            xray_index: (Boolean) Enable Indexing In Xray. Repository will be indexed with the default retention period. You will be able to change it via Xray settings.

Default value is 'false'.
            store_artifacts_locally: (Boolean) When set, the repository should store cached artifacts locally. When not set, artifacts are not stored locally, and direct repository-to-client streaming is used.

Default value is 'false'.
            store_artifacts_locally: (Boolean) When set, the repository should store cached artifacts locally. When not set, artifacts are not stored locally, and direct repository-to-client streaming is used.

            statistics_enabled: (Boolean) If set, Artifactory will notify the remote instance whenever an artifact in the Smart Remote Repository is downloaded locally so that it can update its download counter. Note that if this option is not set, there may be a discrepancy between the number of artifacts reported to have been downloaded in the different Artifactory instances of the proxy chain. Default value is 'false'.
            store_artifacts_locally: (Boolean) When set, the repository should store cached artifacts locally. When not set, artifacts are not stored locally, and direct repository-to-client streaming is used. This can be useful for multi-server setups over a high-speed LAN, with one Artifactory caching certain data on central storage, and streaming it directly to satellite pass-though Artifactory servers.
            synchronize_properties: (Boolean) When set, remote artifacts are fetched along with their properties.
            unused_artifacts_cleanup_period_hours: (Number) Unused Artifacts Cleanup Period (Hr) in the UI. The number of hours to wait before an artifact is deemed 'unused' and eligible for cleanup from the repository. A value of 0 means automatic cleanup of cached artifacts is disabled.

Once it's set, it can't be removed by passing an empty string or removing the attribute, that will be ignored by the Artifactory API. UI shows an error message, if the user tries to remove the value.
            repo_layout_ref: (String) Sets the layout that the repository should use for storing and identifying modules. A recommended layout that corresponds to the package type defined is suggested, and index packages uploaded and calculate metadata accordingly.
            retrieval_cache_period_seconds: (Number) Metadata Retrieval Cache Period (Sec) in the UI. This value refers to the number of seconds to cache metadata files before checking for newer versions on remote server. A value of 0 indicates no caching.

Default value is 'false'.
            store_artifacts_locally: (Boolean) When set, the repository should store cached artifacts locally. When not set, artifacts are not stored locally, and direct repository-to-client streaming is used.

            suppress_pom_consistency_checks: (Boolean) By default, the system keeps your repositories healthy by refusing POMs with incorrect coordinates (path). If the groupId:artifactId:version information inside the POM does not match the deployed path, Artifactory rejects the deployment with a "409 Conflict" error. You can disable this behavior by setting this attribute to 'true'. Default value is 'false'.
            synchronize_properties: (Boolean) When set, remote artifacts are fetched along with their properties.
            unused_artifacts_cleanup_period_hours: (Number) Unused Artifacts Cleanup Period (Hr) in the UI. The number of hours to wait before an artifact is deemed 'unused' and eligible for cleanup from the repository. A value of 0 means automatic cleanup of cached artifacts is disabled.

Default value is 'false'.
            store_artifacts_locally: (Boolean) When set, the repository should store cached artifacts locally. When not set, artifacts are not stored locally, and direct repository-to-client streaming is used. This can be useful for multi-server setups over a high-speed LAN, with one Artifactory caching certain data on central storage, and streaming it directly to satellite pass-though Artifactory servers.
            synchronize_properties: (Boolean) When set, remote artifacts are fetched along with their properties.
            unused_artifacts_cleanup_period_hours: (Number) Unused Artifacts Cleanup Period (Hr) in the UI. The number of hours to wait before an artifact is deemed 'unused' and eligible for cleanup from the repository. A value of 0 means automatic cleanup of cached artifacts is disabled.

From 7.107.1, multiple values are allowed.The attribute should only be used if the repository is already assigned to the existing project. If not, the attribute will be ignored by Artifactory, but will remain in the Terraform state, which will create state drift during the update.
            project_key: (String) Project key for assigning this repository to. Must be 2 - 32 lowercase alphanumeric and hyphen characters. When assigning repository to a project, repository key must be prefixed with project key, separated by a dash.
            properties_enabled: (Boolean) If set, properties for artifacts that have been cached in this repository will be updated if they are modified in the artifact hosted at the remote Artifactory instance. The trigger to synchronize the properties is download of the artifact from the remote repository cache of the local Artifactory instance. Default value is 'false'.
            property_sets: (Set of String) List of property set name
            proxy: (String) Proxy key from Artifactory Proxies settings. Can't be set if disable_proxy = true.

            remote_repo_layout_ref: (String) Repository layout key for the remote layout mapping. Repository can be created without this attribute (or set to an empty string). Once it's set, it can't be removed by passing an empty string or removing the attribute, that will be ignored by the Artifactory API. UI shows an error message, if the user tries to remove the value.
            repo_layout_ref: (String) Sets the layout that the repository should use for storing and identifying modules. A recommended layout that corresponds to the package type defined is suggested, and index packages uploaded and calculate metadata accordingly.
            retrieval_cache_period_seconds: (Number) Metadata Retrieval Cache Period (Sec) in the UI. This value refers to the number of seconds to cache metadata files before checking for newer versions on remote server. A value of 0 indicates no caching.
            share_configuration: (Boolean, Deprecated)
            socket_timeout_millis: (Number) Network timeout (in ms) to use when establishing a connection and for unanswered requests. Timing out on a network operation is considered a retrieval failure.

            statistics_enabled: (Boolean) If set, Artifactory will notify the remote instance whenever an artifact in the Smart Remote Repository is downloaded locally so that it can update its download counter. Note that if this option is not set, there may be a discrepancy between the number of artifacts reported to have been downloaded in the different Artifactory instances of the proxy chain. Default value is 'false'.
            store_artifacts_locally: (Boolean) When set, the repository should store cached artifacts locally. When not set, artifacts are not stored locally, and direct repository-to-client streaming is used. This can be useful for multi-server setups over a high-speed LAN, with one Artifactory caching certain data on central storage, and streaming it directly to satellite pass-though Artifactory servers.
            synchronize_properties: (Boolean) When set, remote artifacts are fetched along with their properties.
            unused_artifacts_cleanup_period_hours: (Number) Unused Artifacts Cleanup Period (Hr) in the UI. The number of hours to wait before an artifact is deemed 'unused' and eligible for cleanup from the repository. A value of 0 means automatic cleanup of cached artifacts is disabled.

Push replication is used to synchronize Local Repositories, and is implemented by the Artifactory server on the near end invoking a synchronization of artifacts to the far end. See the Official Documentation https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Repository+Replication#RepositoryReplication-PushReplication. This resource can create the replication of local repository to single repository on the remote server.

From 7.107.1, multiple values are allowed.The attribute should only be used if the repository is already assigned to the existing project. If not, the attribute will be ignored by Artifactory, but will remain in the Terraform state, which will create state drift during the update.
            project_key: (String) Project key for assigning this repository to. Must be 2 - 32 lowercase alphanumeric and hyphen characters. When assigning repository to a project, repository key must be prefixed with project key, separated by a dash.

Default value is 'false'.
            store_artifacts_locally: (Boolean) When set, the repository should store cached artifacts locally. When not set, artifacts are not stored locally, and direct repository-to-client streaming is used.
